            <img class="home-image" src="./blizzard78.jpg">
            <p>In 1978, a nor'easter parked itself off of the new england coast and dumped copious amounts of snow. The
                entire region was buried in white, catching many folks off-guard and stranding thousands
                .</p>

                    <p>The storm of the century was a huge winter cyclone that barreled up the eastern seaboard. Snow
                        fell from
                        northen
                        Florida to Maine. Snow totals exceeded 3 feet in the most fortunate areas.</p>

            <p class="header">Ho! Ho! Snow!<p>
                    <p>The snow fell at a torrid pace through the night, dumping over 18 inches of
                        fresh powder on the upper mountain. It was the dry, sweep away variety of snow that when gravity
                        is added produces grins as wide as vermont!

                                Mother Nature may bestow up on us. We'll ride the purple mountain majesty down to the
