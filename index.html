            <img src="./blizzard78.jpg">
            <p>In 78, a nor'easter parked itself off of the new england coast and dumped copious amounts of snow on the
                north east. The entire region was buried in white, catching many folks off-guard and stranding thousands
                of vehilces.</p>

            <h1>Ho! Ho! Snow!</h1>
            <p>The snow thankfply fell at a torrid pace through the night, dumping over 18 inches of
                fresh powder on the upper mountain. It was the dry, sweep away variety of snow that can be pushed
                with a broom if
                so much hadn't fallen. Alas, 18 inches was a dream and our burly gang of three amigos headed
                straight for the trees. It wopd be a no lunch day as we ripped and rode with smiles as wide as
                Vermont!
