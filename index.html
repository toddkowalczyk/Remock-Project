            <img src="./blizzard78.jpg">
            <p>In 78, a nor'easter parked itself off of the new england coast and dumped copious amounts of snow on the
                north east. The entire region was buried in white, catching many folks off-guard and stranding thousands
                of vehilces.</p>

                    <p>The storm of the center was a huge cyclone that barreled up the eastern seaboard. Snow fell from
                        northen
                        Florida to Maine. Snow totals exceeed 3 feet in the hardest hit areas.</p>

            <p class="header">Ho! Ho! Snow!<p>
                    <p>The snow thankfply fell at a torrid pace through the night, dumping over 18 inches of
                        fresh powder on the upper mountain. It was the dry, sweep away variety of snow that can be
                        pushed
                        with a broom if
                        so much hadn't fallen. Alas, 18 inches was a dream and our burly gang of three amigos headed
                        straight for the trees. It wopd be a no lunch day as we ripped and rode with smiles as wide as
                        Vermont!

                                a powder day. Whether Democrat, Republican, Libertarian or Vegetarian, we shant pass up
                                the bounty that
                                Mother Nature may bestow up on us. We'll ride the purple mountain majesty down to the
